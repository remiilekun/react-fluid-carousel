## react-fluid-carousel

`react-fluid-carousel` is a react based carousel component. It is built on top of the functionality that [react-window]() offers.

### Why another carousel?

### How to use?

Here is a demo of it working as storybooks.

[Demo](https://nostalgic-snyder-f61435.netlify.com/)

#### Usage details

Let's say you have a set of images that you want to show in a carousel.
It looks like

```js
const imgArray = [
  { id: img1, url: "http://img1" },
  { id: img2, url: "http://img2" },
  { id: img3, url: "http://img3" },
  { id: img4, url: "http://img4" },
  { id: img5, url: "http://img5" },
];
```

Your carousel component would be constructed as

```js
import React from "react";
import Carousel from "react-fluid-carousel";

export default ({ imgArray }) => {
  return (
    <Carousel>
      {imgArray.map((img) => (
        <div key={img.id}>
          <img src={img.url} alt="description" />
        </div>
      ))}
    </Carousel>
  );
};
```

This will look at the width of the Carousel's parent, and calculate how many images can be fit in a window of the carousel. It will then divide the items into pages and provides prev and next buttons. It will show a netflix like focus animation by default on hover over a carousel item.

#### Customising the carousel

`speed` [int in ms] default = 0 - Speed of movement - When you click on the prev/next button, this says how long the animation should last.
`slidesToScroll` [int] default = pageSize - This will scroll the carousel by this number regardless of page size.
`scale` [int] default = 1.2 - This will control the size of the animation on focus.

`renderPrev`/ `renderNext` - These are render prop based methods which you can use to send customised components for prev/next interactions.
It will receive an object as props with the following - `{ disabled, onClick, basicStyle }`
`disabled` [boolean] - Will send true if there is a prev page to scroll to, or if the carousel is in mid-animation.
`onClick` [function] - This has to be called by the custom component for prev/next functionality to work.
`basicStyle` [object] - This is a styles object with values for `height` of the carousel, `top` margin of the carousel items
`scaleX` [int] - This is the X axis scale size when you over on an item.
`scaleY` [int] - This is the Y axis scale size when you over on an item.
`showProgress` [bool] - This is used to determine if you want to show the dots or not (Default: false)

`renderProgress` - This is another render prop based method which you can use to send customised progressunit. It will receive an object with the prop `enabled`, which can help you define the highlighted style of the progress unit. Click on this jumps to the respective page and is handled by the carousel by default.
